As an hourly employee, working a desk job without a set schedule, it can be easy to lose track of time and how long you've been at work.
This project was created to do just that. After I clock in, I fire up this program and start the stopwatch. Then checking it periodically
throughout the day to see if the elasped time has reached eight hours. SimpleStopwatch is written completely in C# using Windows Forms as
the user interface. The word "Simple" is used because the stopwatch does not display milliseconds. Thus giving the UI a more sleek appearance
as the time ticks. 

Features:<br />
Start, pause, and reset buttons.<br />
Right click options: Save, view, save file, show only time, and reset.<br />
Greeting based on the time of day
